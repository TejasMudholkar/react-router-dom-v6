# My React Project

This is a simple React project that uses React Router Dom version 6 to handle routing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the official Node.js website (<https://nodejs.org/en/>).
